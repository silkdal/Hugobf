# Our History

B&F Advocats comes as a result of a joint alliance of two partners, Jose Luis Bou and Jose Antonio Feo, that transitioned from the private sector, each bringing a wealth of diverse expertise to the table.

The firm took root in September 2000 as a visionary venture rooted in legal excellence and unwavering client advocacy seeking to navigate the intricate legal landscape with finesse and deliver innovative solutions tailored to the unique needs of their clientele.

Besides covering a wide array of legal areas for both individuals and businesses, one of the first goals of the firm was focusing on small size companies ensuring they received tailored support and guidance crucial for their growth.

The firm's unique approach of an integrated advisement and guidance of the major compliance duties for the businesses, including Accountancy, Taxes and Working Contracts, was soon proven succesful, as it allows a steadfast commitment to serving the unique legal needs of small-sized companies.

Over these years, the firm's influence has extended beyond local boundaries, and the founders, driven by a shared passion for justice, have fostered a culture that values innovation and adaptability in the ever-evolving legal landscape.

<i>B&F Advocats</i> continues to thrive on a foundation of client-centric principles, blending tradition with innovation, and remains dedicated to empowering clients through comprehensive legal guidance and unwavering advocacy.
